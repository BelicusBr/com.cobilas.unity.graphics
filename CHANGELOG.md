## [3.5.4] (10/02/2024)
- ### Fixed
- - In the internal method `IGUDrawer.RemoveReserialization(IGUObject)` a null argument exception could occur, this occurred when the method first checked whether the object `IGUObject` existed in a list that could be null.
## [3.5.3] - 05/02/2024
- ### Changed
- - Updated dependency `com.cobilas.unity.utility` to version `2.10.3`.
- - This update includes bug fixes and new features that do not directly impact this package.
- - The sub-dependency `com.cobilas.unity.core.net4x@1.4.1` was made explicit in the package dependencies
## [3.5.2] 28/01/2024
### Fixed
The `IGUDrawer` and `CobilasResolutions` classes inherit the `ISceneContainerItem` interface so they can be added to the SceneContainerManager.
## [3.5.1] 28/01/2024
### Fixed
The `IGUStyleStatus.ScaledBackgrounds` property caused compilation errors because it depended on the `GUIStyleState.ScaledBackgrounds` property, which in turn is exclusive to the editor.

### Changed
A change in package dependencies.
## [3.4.1] - 08/09/2023
###Fixed

- The <kbd>Cobilas.Unity.Utility</kbd> assembly reference has been added to <kbd>Cobilas.Unity.Graphics.asmdef</kbd>.
- ps: Lack of attention in this XD.
## [3.4.0] - 08/09/2023
### Changed
- package dependencies have been changed.
## [3.3.1] - 30/08/2023
###Fixed

## [3.2.5] - 22/04/2023
###Fixed
- There was a visual error that occurred when two `IGUWindow` elements were displayed on the screen due to the fact that the same temporary element was used.
- In the styles `Black text field style` and `Black text field border style` the `Text Clipping` field was marked incorrectly with the value `TextClipping.Overflow` which was changed to `TextClipping.Clip`.
### Deprecated
- The methods `GUIStyle:IGUStyle.GetGUIStyleTemp(IGUStyle)` and `GUIStyle:IGUStyle.GetGUIStyleTemp(IGUStyle, int)` are not supported, use the explicit convention of `IGUStyle`.
## [3.2.4] - 18/04/2023
###Fixed
- When calling the `IGUScrollView.ScrollViewAction` event, doNots will not be activated.
## [3.2.3] - 18/04/2023
###Fixed
- The protected field `IGUComboBox.scrollViewBackgroundStyle` was not initialized which caused a null reference.
- Now checking whether the mouse is inside the `IGUComboBox` has been fixed.
- The protected properties `IGUScrollView.alwaysShowVertical` and `IGUScrollView.alwaysShowHorizontal` are not used.
- The positioning of the scrolls has been corrected.
## [3.2.0] - 17/04/2023
### Changed
- Reworked all `CustomPropertyDrawer` classes of `IGUObject` elements.
## [3.1.1] - 17/04/2023
###Fixed
- Fixed problem in the `IIGUObject.internalOnIGU` method of `IGUObjetc` which was incorrectly checking the `IGUObject.Pivot` property. Now only `IGUObject.PivotX` is set correctly.
- Fixed an unexpected error that occurred during the serialization and deserialization process that caused the `GUIStyle tooltipStyle` field to become `GUIStyle.none` when replacing `GUIStyle` with `IGUStyle`.
### Added
- Added protected method `IGUObjetc.LowCallOnIGU()` as new internal process `OnIGU`.
- Added the `IGURectClip` class to make clippings.
### Removed
- Removed methods:
   - `IGUObject.GetDefaultValue(GUIStyle, GUIStyle)`
   - `IGUScrollView.ScrollTo(IGUObject)`
   - `IGUScrollView.ScrollTo(IGURect)`
   - `IGUScrollView.ScrollTo(Rect)`
## [2.3.0] - 15/04/2023
### Added
- Added the `IGUStyle` style class.
## [2.2.1] - 15/04/2023
### Changed
Now the IGUConfig and IGUColor functions are executed in the `void:IIGUObject.InternalOnIGU()` method of the `IGUObject` class.
###Fixed
In the `IGUNumericBox` and `IGUNumericBoxInt` classes, the sub-elements were not parented, which did not change the position of the sub-elements.
### Deprecated
The protected method `Vector2:IGUObject.GetPosition()` is not supported.
### Added
The property `IGUObject.GlobalRect { get; set; }` represents the local position of the `IGUObject` element added to the parent `IGUObject` element.
The protected methods
```c#
protected Rect GetRect(bool iginoreNotMod);
protected Rect GetRect();
```
were added to obtain the position and size.
## [2.1.1] - 14/04/2023
### Changed
Now the properties `IGUTextObject.UseTooltip`, `IGUTextObject.MyContent` and `IGUObject.MyConfg` receive a default value.
## [2.1.0-rc1] - 08/04/2023
### Added
The `IIGUSerializationCallbackReceiver` interface has been added to serialize `IGUObject` in the Editor.
## [2.0.2] - 04/05/2023
### Fixed(IGU)
In `IGUComboBox` there was a problem that occurred when the object was affiliated with another that caused the position of the `IGUComboBox` not to be changed.
### Removed(IGU)
The `BeginDoNotMofifyRect` and `EndDoNotMofifyRect` functions affect child and sub-child objects, and have been replaced by the doNots compo.
`CreateIGUInstance` methods have been removed from all `IGUObject` classes and replaced with
```c#
IGUObject.CreateIGUInstace(Type);
IGUObject.CreateIGUInstace(Type, string);
IGUObject.CreateIGUInstace<T>(string);
IGUObject.CreateIGUInstace<T>();
```
## [1.7.1] - 12/02/2023
### Added
Now the layout schemes have been added.
```c#
public sealed class IGUHorizontalLayout{}
public sealed class IGUVerticalLayout{}
public sealed class IGUGridLayout{}
```
###Fixed
#### IGUObject
In the `IGUConfig:GetModIGUConfig()` method, in addition to checking whether the parent is null, they are also checked
if `parent.GetModIGUConfig().IsEnabled && myConfg.IsEnabled` is `parent.GetModIGUConfig().IsVisible && myConfg.IsVisible`
are true.
In the `Vector2:GetPosition()` method, the parent's position will be obtained from the `parent.myRect.ModifiedPosition` property
which will cause incorrect positioning.
## [1.0.16] - 12/02/2023
###Fixed
In the `IGUConatiner.AddDeepAction(int)` method, the `RefreshDepth();` instruction was executed before the `DeepAction` object
which meant that the first `DeepAction` object was not added to the OnIGU event.
## [1.0.15] - 09/02/2023
###Fixed
#### Depth not applied correctly [#ISU-IGU0001](https://github.com/BelicusBr/com.cobilas.unity.graphics/issues/2)
In the `IGUContainer` class where depth is applied, now when adding a new depth the event responsible for calling `DeepAction.OnIGU()` is updated.
## [1.0.14] - 05/02/2023
###Fixed
In the `void:InitInternalIndowFunction()` method, the `GUI.DragWindow` instruction was executed after the `windowFunction` action, which could cause the window to stop moving due to the fact that
that if any IGU element was disabled or when the `GUI.enabled = false` property was called within the `windowFunction` action.
## [1.0.13] - 30/01/2023
### Changed
- Removal of unused fields.
- Removal of unnecessary assignments.
- Transforming possible fields into `readonly`.
## [1.0.12] 09/01/2023
### Changed
The body of the `public static Vector2Int GetBaseResolutionPlatform()` method has been changed.
## [1.0.9] 06/09/2022
###Fixed
The `IGUEvent` property was removed due to conflicts with the `GUI` class methods.<br/><br/>

In the `IGUDrawer` and `IGUConatiner` classes, there was a problem with the OnIGU events that with each deserialization<br/>
OnIGU events were not cleared which caused IGU elements to be duplicated.

### Changed
Mouse triggers are now detected by the `Imput` class.
## [1.0.7] 02/09/2022
### Fixed (IGUDrawer)
Now the event collected and marked as used.
### Fixed (IGUObjectDrawer)
The statements `property.serializedObject.Update();` and `property.serializedObject.ApplyModifiedProperties();`<br/>
were removed because they caused the values already pre-defined in the inspector to freeze after being changed<br/>
for game mode.
## [1.0.6] 27/08/2022
### Fixed (MarkedText)
In the method `string:MarkedText.ToString();` there was a problem where marking the MarkedText<br/>
like `FontStyle.Normal`, the text did not appear.
### Fixed (IGURect)
In the `Vector2:IGURect.ModifiedPosition` property, the `Vector2:IGURect.ModifiedSize` property is used<br/>
to perform the calculation instead of the `Vector2:IGURect.Size` property as before.
### Added (IGUContainer)
The method
```c#
public static IGUContainer GetOrCreateIGUContainer(string name);
```
creates a new IGUContainer or takes an existing IGUContainer.
### Changed (IGUContainer)
Now the methods `IGUContainer:IGUContainer.CreateGenericIGUContainer();` is `IGUContainer:IGUContainer.CreatePermanentGenericIGUContainer();`<br/>
use the `IGUContainer:IGUContainer.GetOrCreateIGUContainer(string)` method.
### Fixed (IGUDrawer)
In the `void:IGUDrawer.OnGUI()` method, `Event.current` was used to collect the state of the<br/> triggers
mouse, but the problem occurred when the `Event.Use()` method interfered with collecting the state of the <br/> triggers.
mouse which was resolved using the `bool:Event.PopEvent(Event)` method.
## [1.0.2] 31/07/2022
Now the `CobilasResolutions` class is MonoBehaviour.
## [1.0.1] 27/07/2022
### Fixed (IGUDrawer)
When removing an `IGUContainer` object it was not removed from the OnIGU event.
## [1.0.0] 25/07/2022

- Released to GitHub
## [0.1.0] 15/07/2022
